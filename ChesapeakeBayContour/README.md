# Summary
Using Spatial Analyst, our team created 1 meter contours for visualization purposes.  These .shp and geojson files were derrived from NOAA bathymetric data for visualization purposes only.

# Description
Bathymetry for Chesapeake Bay was derived from two hundred ninety-seven surveys containing 3,178,509 soundings. Thirty-five older, less accurate, overlapping surveys were entirely omitted before tinning. Partial overlap from other older, less accurate surveys was also omitted prior to tinning. The surveys used dated from 1859 to 1993. Thirty-six surveys dated from 1859 to 1918, thirty-seven from the 1930s, ninety-one from the 1940s, sixty-six from the 1950s, twenty-five from the 1960s, twenty-four from the 1970s, fourteen from the 1980s, and four from the 1990s. The total range of sounding data was 3.7 meters to -50.4 meters at mean low water. Mean high water values between 0.2 and 1.2 meters were assigned to the shoreline. Fifteen points were found that were not consistent with the surrounding data and were removed prior to tinning. Chesapeake Bay has two hundred eighteen 7.5 minute DEMs and ten one degree DEMs.

Data origniated from 3 arc-second (M130_B30.zip) digital elevation models.
